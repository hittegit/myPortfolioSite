        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            After using my GIBill and graduating from UHCL with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering,
            I found myself working for NASA doing full-stack web development 
            and devops via GitLab.

            In my free time, I enjoy board games, video games, and playing around with 
            single-board computers and micro-controllers.
